#
# nuvexportrc:
#
#  This file contains the configuration for nuvexport, and should be installed
#    as /etc/nuvexportrc or ~/.nuvexportrc (if you use both, the one in your
#    home directory will take precedence).
#
#  The config in this file likely will NOT work, which is why this file has
#    been left out of the makefile and rpm for the time being.
#

#
#   Anything placed within the <nuvexport> section
#
<nuvexport>

#
#  Set export_prog to ffmpeg, transcode or mencoder, depending on your
#    preference of program for exports.  This is equivalent to --ffmpeg,
#    --transcode or --mencoder
#
export_prog=transcode

#
#  Any other parameters set in this file are equivalent to using the equivalent
#    setting as a commandline option.  For boolean options like --deinterlace
#    (--nodeinterlace), use deinterlace=yes (or no, true or false) instead.
#    Actual commandline options will override anything in this file.
#

#
#  Preferred mode -- if you don't set this, nuvexport will ask you what you
#    would like to do.  Use --mode or any of the mode symlinks (like
#    nuvexport-xvid) to override.
#
# mode=xvid

#
#  Setting underscores to yes will convert whitespace in filenames to an
#    underscore character (which some people seem to prefer)
underscores=no

</nuvexport>

#
#  The sections below work as above, with each more specific section overriding
#    the more generic.
#

<generic>

    path = /home/xris/Video

    use_cutlist     = yes
    multipass       = yes

    noise_reduction = yes
    deinterlace     = yes
    crop            = yes

</generic>

#
#  You can create settings for each export module type.  These are the
#    second-most generic sections, and will only be reached if there are no
#    matches in the full or generic module names.
#

<ffmpeg>
    noise_reduction = no
</ffmpeg>

<transcode>
</transcode>

<mencoder>
</mencoder>

#
#  You can also create settings for generic export module names.  These will
#    only be overridden by full module names.
#

<XviD>

    vbr          = yes   # Enable vbr to get the multipass/quantisation options
                         # (enabling multipass or quantisation automatically enables vbr)
    multipass    = yes   # You get either multipass or quantisation; multipass will override
    quantisation = 6     # 4 through 6 is probably right...  1..31 are allowed (lower is better quality)

    a_bitrate    = 128   # Audio bitrate of 128 kbps
    v_bitrate    = 960   # Remember, quantisation overrides video bitrate

    width        = 624   # Height adjusts automatically to width, according to aspect ratio
    height       = auto

</XviD>

#
#  If you want to provide settings for a very specific export module, you can
#    use its full name, and it will override any more generic settings.
