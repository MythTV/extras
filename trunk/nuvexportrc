#
# nuvexportrc:
#
#  This file contains the configuration for nuvexport, and should be installed
#    as /etc/nuvexportrc.  You can also copy this file to ~/.nuvexportrc, where
#    nuvexport will look first, if you wish to create settings local to a
#    specific user.
#
#  support for nuvexportrc is still new, so expect that more default options
#    will be added as time goes on (so you'll know what you can edit).  In the
#    meantime, you can poke around in the code for add_arg() calls to see which
#    options are available.
#

#
#  Anything placed within the <nuvexport> section will be interpreted
#    as a global option.  Use this section for options that don't relate
#    specifically to any particular exporter.
#
<nuvexport>

    #
    #  Set export_prog to ffmpeg, transcode or mencoder, depending on your
    #    preference of program for exports.  This is equivalent to --ffmpeg,
    #    --transcode or --mencoder
    #
    export_prog=ffmpeg

    #
    #  Any other parameters set in this file are equivalent to using the equivalent
    #    setting as a commandline option.  For boolean options like --deinterlace
    #    (--nodeinterlace), use deinterlace=yes (or no, true or false) instead.
    #    Actual commandline options will override anything in this file.
    #

    #
    #  Preferred mode -- if you don't set this, nuvexport will ask you what you
    #    would like to do.  Use --mode or any of the mode symlinks (like
    #    nuvexport-xvid) to override.
    #
    #mode=xvid

    #
    #  Setting underscores to yes will convert whitespace in filenames to an
    #    underscore character (which some people seem to prefer)
    #
    underscores=no

    #
    #  Setting require_cutlist to yes will tell nuvexport to show only those
    #    recordings that have a cutlist
    #
    require_cutlist=yes

</nuvexport>

#
#  The sections below work as above, with each more specific section overriding
#    the more generic.
#

<generic>

    path = .

    use_cutlist     = yes
    multipass       = yes

    noise_reduction = yes
    deinterlace     = yes
    crop            = yes

</generic>

#
#  You can create settings for each export module type.  These are the
#    second-most generic sections, and will only be reached if there are no
#    matches in the full or generic module names.
#

<ffmpeg>
#
# ffmpeg is almost twice as fast if you disable noise reduction
#
#    noise_reduction = no
#
# If you have a clean signal, you might want to try to use fast_denoise
# with ffmpeg (it's actually part of yuvdenoise, which the ffmpeg exporter
# uses).  It can be almost twice as fast as normal noise reduction, but is
# nowhere near as effective.
#
#    fast_denoise = yes
#
</ffmpeg>

<transcode>
</transcode>

<mencoder>
</mencoder>

#
#  You can also create settings for generic export module names.  These will
#    only be overridden by full module names.
#

<XviD>

    vbr          = yes   # Enable vbr to get the multipass/quantisation options
                         # (enabling multipass or quantisation automatically enables vbr)
    multipass    = yes   # You get either multipass or quantisation; multipass will override
    quantisation = 6     # 4 through 6 is probably right...  1..31 are allowed (lower is better quality)

    a_bitrate    = 128   # Audio bitrate of 128 kbps
    v_bitrate    = 960   # Remember, quantisation overrides video bitrate

    width        = 624   # Height adjusts automatically to width, according to aspect ratio
    height       = auto

</XviD>

#
#  Default mp3 bitrate is 128
#
<MP3>
    bitrate = 128
</MP3>

#
#  If you want to provide settings for a very specific export module, you can
#    use its full name, and it will override any more generic settings.
