#
# nuvexportrc:
#
#  This file contains the configuration for nuvexport, and should be installed
#    as /etc/nuvexportrc or ~/.nuvexportrc (if you use both, the one in your
#    home directory will take precedence).
#
#  The config in this file likely will NOT work, which is why this file has
#    been left out of the makefile and rpm for the time being.
#

#
#   Anything placed within the <nuvexport> section
#
<nuvexport>

#
#  Set export_prog to ffmpeg or transcode, depending on your preference of
#    program for exports.  This is equivalent to --ffmpeg or --transcode.
#
export_prog=transcode

#
#  Any other parameters set in this file are equivalent to using the equivalent
#    setting as a commandline option.  For boolean options like --deinterlace
#    (--nodeinterlace), use deinterlace=yes (or no, true or false) instead.
#    Actual commandline options will override anything in this file.
#

#
#  Preferred mode -- if you don't set this, nuvexport will ask you what you
#    would like to do.  Use --mode or any of the mode symlinks (like
#    nuvexport-xvid) to override.
#
# mode=xvid

#
#  Setting underscores to yes will convert whitespace in filenames to an
#    underscore character (which some people seem to prefer)
underscores=no

#  The sections below work as above, with each more specific section overriding
#    the more generic.
