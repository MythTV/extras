.Bd -literal
1) Choose export type from the prompts, detaisl of the choices are below 
    in EXPORT TYPES section
2) Choose from the show titles.
3) Choose a specific show from the titles, you may select a number of 
    different shows, and batch them for re-encode
4) hit "c" to continue and begin the reencode process
5) the following questions are usually ok to leave with defaults, 
    especially if you are unsure as to their function

.Sh DIAGNOSTICS

.Sh DEPENDANCIES
.Nm
depends on the following programs to work
.Bd -literal
ffmpeg : used to re-encode the nuv to requested media type for WMV
transcode : used to re-encode to VCD, SVCD, DVD, and XviD
mplex : used to recombine the video and audio streams
tcmplex : alternate program used for recombining video and audio
Time::HiRes : Perl module for time calculations
avidemux2 : demultiplexes MPEG2 files
Xvfb : used to keep avidemux2 from requiring a X11 GUI frontend
lvemux : remultiplex MPEG2 files

.Sh EXPORT TYPES
Supported export formats:
.Pp
.Bd -literal
XviD - export to XviD AVI file
SVCD - export to SVCD compliaint mpeg files, optionally burn SVCD disc
VCD - export to VCD compliant mpeg files, optionally burn VCD disc
DVCD - export to VCD format, but using 48kHz audio, useful for DVDs
DVD - export to DVD
WMV - Windows Media Player files, exports ASF files with the mpeg4 codec
MP3 - Export audio track to a Mp3
MPEG2->MPEG2 cut - cuts commercials tagged by mythtv and gives 
    you a mpeg file. This only works for Mpeg-2 recorded media,
    like that recorded with a PVR-x25 card
nuv and sql - dumps mysql database so it can be moved to another 
    mythtv backend
