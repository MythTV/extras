.Sh NAME
.Nm nuvexport-vcd
.Nd export nuv files created by mythtv to vcd compliand mpeg files
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm

.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is a perl script built to assist in exporting .NUV files from mythtv into vcd directly, it runs nuvexport using the vcd export option

The output is a VCD compliant .mpg file
.Sh OPTIONS
.Nm
takes all the same options as nuvexport, except for the --mode option

.Sh USAGE
See nuvexport's main manpage for the general usage of the program, this manpage deals with specifics of the 
.Nm
exporter

.Bd -literal
The following are all the questions that are asked as part of the encode process for the most part, the defaults should work well.  VCD requires these options to stay standard.

Where would you like to export the files to? [.]
    This is where you would like to export the files to
Enable Myth cutlist? [Yes]
    This uses the MythTV cutlist during the reencode process to 
    transcode only specific portions.  This can be used to remove 
    commercials if they are tagged as such in mythfrontend.
Enable noise reduction (slower, but better results)? [Yes]
    This will enable a noise reduction algoritm to clean the 
    recording up.  This will however cost you some time in the 
    reencode process
Enable deinterlacing? [Yes]
    This will deinterlace the video to make it play better on a 
    computer monitor.  The interlaced signal is build for television 
    outputs, and does not render well on a standard monitor
Crop broadcast overscan (2% border)? [Yes]
    Removes the border around the video to clean up the recording.
