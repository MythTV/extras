This utility maps the old subversion changesets to the new git
hashes, and allows old references to continue to work using URLs
such as the following:

  http://code.mythtv.org/svnredirect/26280

If there is a 1:1 matching, the link redirects directly to the
relevent page on github.  If the changeset is instead mapped to
code that is now in multiple repositories, this displays a page
with links to each.

This uses the existing database lookup tables as produced for
use with the MythLogBot IRC bot.
